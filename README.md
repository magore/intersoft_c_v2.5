## Files
  * Documents/Intersoft_C_Compiler_v2.5_1982_Intersoft_Unlimited.pdf
    * PDF of scanned Intersoft Manual

  * First mention of Intersoft Unlimited and the compiler in print
    * Dr. Dobb's Journal Number 51, July 1981 pg 4-7
      * As an introduction to our company we wrote a 4 page bug report and fix for Ron Cain's Small-C.
      * Intersoft had already created a much enhanced version of Small-C that worked on TRS-80, CPM and 6909 Flex systems. We offered it for sale in the Dr. Dobb's article so we got a bit of free advertising.
      * Triva 
        * I used my own home address in the article for Intersoft's address. We were all students at the University of Waterloo at the time and had yet to create a PO box for the company.
        * We only ran Intersoft for a little over two years as work and life caught up with us all. 
        * After closing Intersoft we released the source code and the manual to the public publishing on a mailing list in the pre-internet era..
